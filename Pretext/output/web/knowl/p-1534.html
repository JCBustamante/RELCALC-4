<div class="para">In real life, there is most often more than one variable. We wish to organize dealing with multiple variables in a consistent manner, and in particular organize dealing with linear equations and linear mappings, as those both rather useful and rather easy to handle. Mathematicians joke that “to an engineer every problem is linear, and everything is a matrix.” And well, they (the engineers) are not wrong. Quite often, solving an engineering problem is figuring out the right finite-dimensional linear problem to solve, which is then solved with some matrix manipulation. Most importantly, linear problems are the ones that we know how to solve, and we have many tools to solve them. For engineers, mathematicians, physicists, and anybody in a technical field it is absolutely vital to learn linear algebra.</div>

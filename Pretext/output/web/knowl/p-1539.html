<div class="para">When we do algebra with these <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-tuples of numbers we call them <em class="emphasis">vectors</em>  <a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-22-hidden.html" title="Footnote 6.1.6"><sup> 6 </sup></a>. Mathematicians are keen on separating what is a vector and what is a point of the space or in the plane, and it turns out to be an important distinction, however, for the purposes of linear algebra we can think of everything being represented by a vector. A way to think of a vector, which is especially useful in calculus and differential equations, is an arrow. It is an object that has a <em class="emphasis">direction </em> and a <em class="emphasis">magnitude</em>. For example, the vector <span class="process-math">\((1,2)\)</span> is the arrow from the origin to the point <span class="process-math">\((1,2)\)</span> in the plane. The magnitude is the length of the arrow. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/linalg-vecarrow_fig.html" title="Figure 6.1.1">See 6.1.1</a>. If we think of vectors as arrows, the arrow doesn't always have to start at the origin. If we do move it around, however, it should always keep the same direction and the same magnitude.</div>

<div class="para">We should reiterate that while <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is unique (a subspace cannot have two different dimensions), the set of basis vectors is not at all unique. There are lots of different bases for any given subspace. Finding just the right basis for a subspace is a large part of what one does in linear algebra. In fact, that is what we spend a lot of time on in linear differential equations, although at first glance it may not seem like that is what we are doing.</div>

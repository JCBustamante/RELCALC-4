<div class="para">Another popular notation is <span class="process-math">\(\mathbf{x}\text{,}\)</span> although we will use the little arrows. It may be easy to write a bold letter in a book, but it is not so easy to write it by hand on paper or on the board. Mathematicians often don't even write the arrows. A mathematician would write <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and just remember that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is a vector and not a number. Just like you remember that Bob is your uncle, and you don't have to keep repeating “Uncle Bob” and you can just say “Bob.” In this book, however, we will call Bob “Uncle Bob” and write vectors with the little arrows.</div>

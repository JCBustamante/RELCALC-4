<div class="para">In other words, <span class="process-math">\(x=2\text{.}\)</span> Once we have that, we plug in <span class="process-math">\(x=2\)</span> into the first equation to find <span class="process-math">\(2-y=2\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(y=0\text{.}\)</span> OK , that was easy. What is all this fuss about linear equations. Well, try doing this if you have 5000 unknowns<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-17-hidden.html" title="Footnote 6.1.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>. Also, we may have such equations not of just numbers, but of functions and derivatives of functions in differential equations. Clearly we need a more systematic way of doing things. A nice consequence of making things systematic and simpler to write down is that it becomes easier to have computers do the work for us. Computers are rather stupid, they do not think, but are very good at doing lots of repetitive tasks precisely, as long as we figure out a systematic way for them to perform the tasks.</div>

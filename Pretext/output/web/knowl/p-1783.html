<div class="para">These vectors are not linearly independent as we saw above. In particular, the span <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v}_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v}_3\)</span> is the same as the spen of all four of the vectors. So <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v}_2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v}_4\)</span> can both be written as linear combinations of <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v}_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v}_3\text{.}\)</span> A common thing that comes up in practice is that one gets a set of vectors whose span is the set of solutions of some problem. But perhaps we get way too many vectors, we want to simplify. For example above, all vectors in the span of <span class="process-math">\(\vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2, \vec{v}_3, \vec{v}_4\)</span> can be written <span class="process-math">\(\alpha_1 \vec{v}_1 + \alpha_2 \vec{v}_2 + \alpha_3 \vec{v}_3 + \alpha_4 \vec{v}_4\)</span> for some numbers <span class="process-math">\(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3,\alpha_4\text{.}\)</span> But it is also true that every such vector can be written as <span class="process-math">\(a \vec{v}_1 + b \vec{v}_3\)</span> for two numbers <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> And one has to admit, that looks much simpler. Moreover, these numbers <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are unique. More on that in the next section.</div>

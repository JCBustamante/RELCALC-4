<div class="para">So the answer is not really. But if we consider vectors in finite-dimensional spaces <span class="process-math">\({\mathbb R}^n\)</span> then yes, every linear mapping is a matrix. We have mentioned at the beginning of this section, that we can “make everything a vector.” That's not strictly true, but it is true approximately. Those “infinite-dimensional” spaces of functions can be approximated by a finite-dimensional space, and then linear operators are just matrices. So approximately, this is true. And as far as actual computations that we can do on a computer, we can work only with finitely many dimensions anyway. If you ask a computer or your calculator to plot a function, it samples the function at finitely many points and then connects the dots<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-23-hidden.html" title="Footnote 6.1.7"><sup> 7 </sup></a>. It does not actually give you infinitely many values. So the way that you have been using the computer or your calculator so far has already been a certain approximation of the space of functions by a finite-dimensional space.</div>
